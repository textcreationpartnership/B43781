            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS humbly Offered for Passing the Bill now Tendred, for encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging the Taking of Prizes from the <hi>French</hi> King, and for explaining an Act made in the First Year of Their now Majesties Reign, for <hi>Prohibiting all Trade and Commerce with</hi> France.</head>
            <p>THE intent of the said Act was to impoverish the <hi>French</hi> King, and disable his Subjects; for which purpose, the granting of private Commissions and Letters of Mart, for taking the Enemies Ships, Men, and Merchandises, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as is usual in War) was always deem'd a very necessary Expedient: but for want of due encouragement, all persons are discourag'd from acting under such private Commissions.</p>
            <list>
               <head>The Benefits that will arise from this, are,</head>
               <item>I. Many Privateers will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t out upon this account and thereby the number of Seamen will be much increased, and ready and experienced to serve His Majesty's Occasions.</item>
               <item>II. Many <hi>French</hi> Prisoners will be taken in the Prizes they shall bring in, which being exchang'd for our <hi>English</hi> Prisoners in <hi>France,</hi> will bring home many Seamen for His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Service; as may appear by the Example of one small Privateer of ten Guns, which in fifteen days time brought into <hi>Guernsey</hi> and <hi>Dartmouth</hi> near an hundred Prisoners.</item>
               <item>III. For want of this encouragement, many able and experienc'd Seamen, that are and may be taken, will be utterly lost, and condemn'd to the Galleys, for want of <hi>French</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners to exchange for them; which emboldens the Enemy, and will increase their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to the empairing of the Courage of His Majesty's Subjects, who are under the dreadful apprehensions that there is no Redemption from Slavery and the Galleys, for want of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners to exchange.</item>
               <item>IV. These Privateers will so infest the Trade and Commerce of <hi>France,</hi> that one part of <hi>France</hi> will not be able to supply the others wants. As for Example: <hi>Gascoigne</hi> and <hi>Poicton</hi> will not be able to supply <hi>Britanny, Normandy, Piccardy,</hi> and their Conquests in <hi>Flanders,</hi> with Brandy, Wines, Vinegar, Salt, Pruans, and such-like Commodities, which they can have from no other part; and moreover, They will be able to obstruct the <hi>French</hi> King's Salt-Trade, by which he furnishes his Gabels, and by consequence lessen his Revenues</item>
               <item>V. Privateers often serve for Convoys, being always at Command, and will secure the Trade of our own Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts, which for want of them are infested by our Enemies-Men of War and Privateers.</item>
               <item>VI. The Goods taken by Prize will turn to great Advantage to His Majesty in the Tenths and Customs thereof, and will be a present fund for the raising Fory or Fifty thousand pounds.</item>
            </list>
            <p>It may be objected, <hi>That in allowing the Privateers Demands, under such colour many private Contracts may be made to bring in</hi> French <hi>Goods under the notion of Prize.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Answer:
<list>
                  <item>I. If any Prize be brought in, she must be condemn'd, which will cost Ten <hi>per Cent.</hi> of her value, comprehending what will be embezled, and other Charges.</item>
                  <item>II. The King must have Ten <hi>per Cent.</hi> for his Tenth.</item>
                  <item>III. The Privateers men must have one Third, which is Thirty-three <hi>per Cent.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>IV. For Victualling and Fitting-out the Privateer Ten <hi>per Cent.</hi> more at least may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; so the whole Charge amounts to Sixty-three <hi>per Cent.</hi> And forasmuch as nothing but the expectation of great Profit could make a man propose bringing in his Goods after this manner; Who, is it to be suppos'd, would adventure, when the Charge is so great as Sixty-three <hi>per Cent.</hi> besides the hazard of the Seas, Customs, and other Duties?</item>
                  <item>V. The smallest Privateer must have Twenty men, or more; and altho the Captain and one or two more may be in a Confederacy with you, yet nevertheless you cannot expect to silence the Tongues of the others, who upon the least quarrel will discover the Design, to the loss of all, besides the being liable to the Penalty of the Act.</item>
                  <item>VI. Some Road or River must be appointed where the Ship is to be taken and brought in by consent; and may not another Privateer come there and take cin, and so deprive you of all?</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And as a further discouragement to such Importation, it may be so provided, That if there be proved any connivance in bringing in any Goods under the notion of Prize, that then the Privateers Ship and the Prize shall be both forfeited; one part to the Informer, and the other to the King, besides all the other Penalties in the Act of Prohibition.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is hoped the Bill will pass, which is only for encouraging the taking of <hi>French</hi> Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>zes by Their Majesties Ships of War and Privateers, whose Services may be so conducing to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of Their Majesties, Preservation of their Subjects, and the annoying and dispoiling of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; which are so high Considerations and Inducements, as not to be departed from for fear of an imaginary inconvenience of driving a covert Trade with <hi>France;</hi> which, for the Reasons abovesaid, (as matters now stand) cannot ensue without great Expence and Hazard, and may be additionally provided against, so as to strengthen it beyond all question.</p>
